## Tech stack
- Vanilla HTML, CSS, JS (no build steps required)
- Progressive Web App: `manifest.webmanifest` + `service-worker.js`
- Data storage: `localStorage`
- External data:
  - FX: https://api.frankfurter.app (ECB rates)
  - Crypto prices: https://api.coingecko.com (simple price endpoint)

## Quick start
Because this is a static PWA, you can run it from any static server.

- Option A: Simple local server (Node)
  - `npx http-server` (or `npx serve`) from the project root
  - Open http://localhost:8080 (or the URL printed by your server)
- Option B: PHP built‚Äëin server
  - `php -S localhost:8080 -t .`
  - Open http://localhost:8080
- Option C: Any static host (HTTPS recommended for PWA)
  - GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, etc.

PWA features (install prompt, service worker) require HTTPS or `localhost`.

## File structure (important files)
- `index.html` ‚Äî The entire app UI + logic (SPA). Contains all views and JS for state, rendering, and actions
- `service-worker.js` ‚Äî Offline caching with cache‚Äëfirst strategy and offline fallback
- `manifest.webmanifest` ‚Äî PWA metadata (name, icons, theme, shortcuts)
- `offline.html` ‚Äî Offline fallback page used by the service worker
- Icons ‚Äî `icon-192.png`, `icon-512.png`, `apple-touch-icon-180.png`, SVGs

Vendor files under `vendor/` are present due to Composer scaffolding but are not required to run the app.

## Pages / Views
Navigation is handled within `index.html` using buttons in the left sidebar. Each view is a section that is shown/hidden (no page reloads).

### Top bar controls (always visible)
- Theme toggle (Light/Dark)
- Lock ‚Äî manually locks the app when a password is set
- Install App ‚Äî appears when the browser allows PWA installation

## Data model & storage
- Stored under localStorage key `loan-tracker:v3`
- Structure (simplified):
  - loans: [{ id, borrower, currency, apr, startDate, notes, balance, totalRepaid, totalInterest, lastCalcDate, closed, createdAt, terms: { rateSchedule:[{from, apr}], interestOnlyUntil, late:{enabled, amount, graceDays} }, txns:[...] }]
  - accounts: [{ id, type, name, currency, amount, note }]
  - investments: [{ id, name, currency, amount, mode, note }]
  - crypto: [{ id, ticker, quantity, buyPrice, currency, note, lots:[{qty, price, date}], realizedPL, lastPrice: { SGD, INR, USD } }]
  - transactions: [{ id, date, type, account, accountName, target, targetName, category, amount, currency, note }]
  - categories: ["Food", "Transport", ...]
  - monthlyTotals: { "YYYY-MM": { Category: { SGD, INR, USD, fx:{INR, USD} } } }
  - budgets: { "YYYY-MM": { Category: Number (stored in SGD) } }
  - goals: [{ id, name, currency, target, current, targetDate }]
  - settings: { lockEnabled, rollover, lotMethod }
  - cache: { rates: { ts, data }, prices: { [ids]: { ts, data } } }

Notes:
- A one‚Äëtime migration step auto‚Äëloads prior `loan-tracker:v2` data if present
- FX cache TTL ‚âà 10 minutes; Crypto prices cache TTL ‚âà 2 minutes

## Currency & FX
- Base currency is for display (SGD/INR/USD). Accounts/transactions stay in their native currency
- FX conversion uses a snapshot from Frankfurter (SGD‚ÜíINR,SGD‚ÜíUSD). Net worth and category totals use this snapshot for on‚Äëscreen aggregation

## PWA, offline & installation
- Service worker caches core assets (`index.html`, icons, manifest, `offline.html`)
- Works offline; live data (FX/crypto) refresh when network returns
- Installation prompt supported (Add to Home Screen / Install App). Button appears when available
- On iOS, use Safari ‚Üí Share ‚Üí Add to Home Screen
- iOS safe‚Äëarea insets (notch) are handled in CSS

## Accessibility & mobile UX
- Responsive grid and mobile drawer sidebar
- Buttons include labels/aria attributes where applicable
- Prevents scroll bleed when mobile menu is open

## Deployment
- Serve the project root over HTTPS for best PWA behavior
- If you modify static assets, consider bumping the `CACHE` version in `service-worker.js` to invalidate old caches
- Ensure `manifest.webmanifest`, `service-worker.js`, and icons reside at the app root alongside `index.html`


## Troubleshooting
- PWA not installing? Check HTTPS or use `localhost`, verify manifest and service worker paths
- Seeing stale assets? Clear site data or increment `CACHE` name in `service-worker.js`
- Crypto prices not updating? CoinGecko rate limited or offline ‚Äî try again after a few minutes
- FX rates not showing? Frankfurter unreachable ‚Äî app falls back to last cached or default values

## AI Mode (on-device heuristics)
- The app includes lightweight, on-device ‚ÄúAI Mode‚Äù helpers that generate natural suggestions without calling external LLMs.
- Areas covered:
  - Financial Health tips on Dashboard
  - Goals ‚Äî monthly allocation suggestions
  - Lending ‚Äî follow-up urgency and reminders
  - Crypto ‚Äî allocation/concentration notes
  - Transaction notes ‚Äî smart, natural phrasing for quick entry
- Naturalness improvements: phrasing now varies with randomized synonyms, sentence structures, and context (amounts, time of day, last activity). This avoids repetitive, fixed text.
- Privacy: all suggestions are generated in your browser; no data leaves your device.
- Tip: Because phrasing is intentionally varied, two clicks may yield different wording while conveying the same guidance. If you prefer consistent phrasing, you can copy your favorite suggestion into the note field and edit as needed.
